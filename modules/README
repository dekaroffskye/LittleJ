Modules contains a single directory of code named littlej which stands for Little John

In this library the code and it's interface come along in the same folder... enough namespace polution!

There are apropriately placed Makefiles, go find them, it should be easy :-)

For now the library doesn't respect const-ness, sorry bout that ;-)
